      <p>
        I built this website in order to showcase my skills in design /
        development / deployment and extend my knowledge of software
        engineering.
      </p>

      <span>Svelte:</span>
      <p>
        This website is built using the framework Svelte. It was for me the
        opportunity to try and learn that framework. I was interested in how
        Svelte is design differently than Angular or React, and wanted to be
        able to compare it with the others that I already tried.
      </p>

      <span>Tailwindcss:</span>
      <p>
        For the styling part, I didn't need a library full of components and
        didn't wanted to write only css. This is why I tried Tailwindcss, which
        is utility based. I also learn Tailwindcss while creating this website.
      </p>

      <span>Deployment:</span>
      <p>
        This website is proudly deployed on my personal server (aka, a potato
        computer ðŸ¥” running on Ubuntu, please don't break it)
      </p>
      <p>
        The app has been containerized and deployed using docker and Portainer.
        The build and publication of the image is automated through Github
        Actions, another technology I wanted to try. I used to GitOps with
        Gitlab but never with Github, and this was a good opportunity to finally
        try it.

      <p>
        In 2019, when I was in engineering school, I started to use an computer
        (potato computer but still) as a server. My first ideas about this, was
        to have a (cheap) server for team project and personal projects. Since
        then, I had time to practice a lot on it.
      </p>

      <span>At school</span>
      <p>
        I used to do a lot of projects for school and most of them were group
        projects. For instance, we needed databases, website hosting,
        application deployment, network administration among other things.
      </p>

      <span>Networks</span>
      <p>
        The main issue at first was remote access. At the time, I had no control
        of my home router, so no way to open ports. This is how I started to get
        an interest in networks and I learned and discovered a lot about it,
        which include Zerotier and Tailscale. These two are basically P2P VPN, I
        won't explain how it works here, but it's very interesting. Thanks to
        Zerotier, I was able to have multiple P2P networks and it became really
        useful for group projects and remotely managing y server.
